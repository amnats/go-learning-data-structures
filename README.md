# Learning data structures in Go

Here you can 👨‍🎓learn with me about most commonly used data structures: their strength and weaknesses, complexities and implementation details.

Implementations of data structures here are made purely for educational purposes. They are not thread safe if not stated otherwise.
Also all of the data structures here are not generic 🤷‍♂️ (there are still no generics in Go unfortunately).
